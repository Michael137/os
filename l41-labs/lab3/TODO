* State machine behaviour use -B -q
- Plot two directions of TCP state machine
  * client vs. server
  - TCP header flags (or syscall/timer) of received packet cause the transition
  - Instrument headers in syncache
  - Compare to RFC 793
- Affect of latency on state machine (0-40ms)
* Probe effect
* ipc/ipc-static -B -q -i tcp 2thread

* Only I/O loop analysis
* ipc/ipc-static -i tcp -b 1048576 (-s) 2thread
* Flush cache
* Bandwidth vs. Latency [0-40ms] (with and without resizing)
* Bandwidth vs. Real-time (with and without resizing)
  * Stack congestion and last received windows graph
- Only consider tcp steady state (i.e. no handshake or connection close)
~ Sequence Number vs. Real-time (with and without resizing)
  - Few packets past slow start
  * 10ms and 20ms RTT (i.e. 5 and 10ms latency)
  - Effect of latency on time to enter steady state
    - Then effect on bandwidth
  - graph bytes-in-flight
