OccamOS (occam operating system)

* Does few things really well
* Fast build times
* Harmony between: Editing<->Compilation<->Data<->OS services<->Version Control
* Convenient shell and exposure to OS incl. draw routines
* Searchable and transparent
* Files should be accessible from anywhere at any time. No more redundant cd's (related to filed)
* Fully transparent: limited abstraction of hardware interface
* Instrumentable, debuggable, profileable by construction
* Accelerator coordination
* No overly generic HALs
* Mobile and distributed
